# FilDeFer
coding a visual representation of a map given as text using the minilbx.
We have to  convert a file containing a grid of height  values into a 3d wireframe.
As a bonus, we had to make our program able to parse the grid in order to get colors to put between our dots. 
Once launched you can Zoom, Dezoom, Rotate and move the map.

## Example

Representation of a land:

Map containing 2 colors and representing a fractal:
